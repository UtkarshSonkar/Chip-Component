# React Chip Component

This custom React Chip Component provides a dynamic and responsive interface for selecting and managing items as chips. It is built from scratch, does not rely on external UI libraries, and is ideal for applications requiring tag selection or multi-value inputs.

## Features

- **Interactive Chip Interface**: An input field that displays a list of items, filtered as the user types.
- **Real-Time Filtering**: Only shows items that match the user's input, updating the list in real time.
- **Chip Creation and Display**: Converts selected items into chips that appear above the input field.
- **Chip Deletion**: Allows users to remove chips with a simple click, returning the item to the suggestion list.
- **State Management**: Manages the state of items and chips using React's `useState` hook.
- **Enhanced Backspace Functionality**: Allows users to highlight and delete the last chip by pressing backspace on an empty input field
